## Installation

The script is made for openSUSE Tumbleweed. I didn't include Nvidia support.

> [!CAUTION]
> Examine the script thoroughly before executing it on your system, as it may cause harm to your system.
> I have not tested this configuration on Linux distributions other than openSUSE Trumbleweed, so use it
> with caution, but it should work.

Install openSUSE Tumbleweed as a server or a desktop environment with GNOME or KDE, both should work with the script.

TODO: Create an installation script
